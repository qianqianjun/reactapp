/*
 mobile apps was differ from desktop apps and the web in how they are distributed and how they interact with user data on the device.

 Generally apps are distributed through internet accessible app stores controlled by the device manufacturer which is simpler for end users and offer better security guarantees over arbitrary download models apps run inside security sandboxes which gives the user a more fine grained control over what user data the app is allowed or update.

 apps can also be feature updated and security patched more easily through the app store push mechanism.

 移动应用程序与桌面应用程序和网络在分布方式以及它们如何与设备上的用户数据交互方面有所不同。

 一般来说，应用通过设备制造商控制的互联网可访问应用商店进行分发，对于最终用户来说更简单，并且提供对任意下载模型的更好安全保证，应用在安全沙箱内部运行，使用户能够更好地控制应用的用户数据 允许或更新。

 应用程序也可以通过应用程序商店推送机制更轻松地进行功能更新和安全修补。

Apple choose to completely control the manufacturer of the phone and tablet hardware and the
development of its proprietary IOS software platform only hardware distributed by Apple runs on
the platform ,and Apple also completely controls how software is distributed to end user devices
by itself and by third party developers.

In contrast ,Google chose to license its Android platform to third party OEM's to manufacture
their own hardware with the option to customize individual Android distributions .


 苹果选择完全控制手机和平板电脑硬件的制造商
 其专有的IOS软件平台的开发仅由Apple分发的硬件运行
 该平台和Apple也完全控制了软件如何分发给最终用户设备
 本身和第三方开发者。

 相比之下，Google选择将其Android平台授权给第三方OEM进行制造
 他们自己的硬件可以选择定制个人Android发行版。

/*
 1.A natively wrapped-app is a web-app which has been packaged up as a native app
 and is distributable through the App Store mechanism. A natively
 wrapped-App is not a true native app but it shares many similarities with native apps.
 Compared with standard web-apps a natively wrapped-app has more access to
 specific hardware features .

 2.the native app is a mobile app developed in a native platform programming language directly targeting the native platform
 interfaces or API of the platform.

 The principal advantage of building apps natively is that the developer has full access to all the
 features offered by the platform API's and the associated hardware.
 Generally native apps will also have better performance as they are developed
 and compiled in platform native languages like Objective C or
 Java.

 1.A native web-app is a native-app created using web technologies.
 Unlike a pure web-app or a natively wrapped-app there is no browser involved in either the development or the runtime of these apps. Where web
 technologies play a role is how these apps are authored.

 2.A native web-app is created using web technologies like javascript and CSS,
 but compiled down to native-apps which can be distributed and executed like normal native-apps.

 3.The native web-app API's adapted specifically for generic mobile platform concepts and
 user interface components and behavior.

 4.The principal proposition of native web-apps is that of the ease of development and portability.
 In theory a W3C inspired development stack having a web development approach to app construction is
 easier to develop with and maintain compared with the relatively complex stack required to create
 pure native-apps. Native web-app API's are not completely portable between target platforms
 for example iOS and Android. But there is a high degree of overlap which makes code base sharing
 much easier.

1.different:
 (1).there is no browser involved in either the development or the runtime of WebNative-apps;

 (2).there is no document object model or DOM in native-apps in the way that you would find in a
 typical web-app. Consequently HTML and CSS do not play the same role here.
2.the same:
they all use javascript as their develop language.
